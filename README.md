# Ex03_DesignPatterns
An integrated Facebook app using C# .NET in the course Design Patterns with guy Ronen

The project is meant to give the user the basic facebook experience with a few extra features.

This project is the final project of the second course of Guys Ronen.
The course is called "Applied programming with the help of design patterns"

Inside the course we learn and understand UML(Class, Sequence, Use case) and as the name suggests we learn about
Design patters.

We learn about the three units of DP which are: 
1. Creational Design Patterns
2. Structural Patterns
3. Behavioral Design Patterns 

The Design Patterns we learned are most of the patterns from the book 
"Gang of Four - Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"

In the project we used:
Abstract Factory
Chain Of Command
Factory Method
Proxy
Strategy
Singleton
 and more

There are some parts of the project which work asynchronously
For the project to work You need To make sure you have the FBApi which should contain
1. FbGraphApiWrapper.dll
2. Facebook.dll
3. Might contain other Files.

When first running You might encounter a momentarily problem in which you have to run a x64 instead of AnyCPU.

After that please put your own facebook details or create a fake one(none of your personal details are saved - you can even check)

after that you can enjoy the facebook experience with extra features.
